    An implementation of the Evolved Packet Core network.
    
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  Openair-cn is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications concerning the 
  Evolved Packet Core Networks, that means it contains the implementation of the
  following network elements: MME, HSS, S-GW+P-GW.

Linux
#---------------------
  The Openair-cn code actually is written, executed, and tested on UBUNTU desktop xenial, bionic soon.
  The S-GW network element requires a linux kernel version 3.19 (for tag <= v0.3.2), tested on UBUNTU desktop 14.04 64 bits.
  The S-GW network element requires a linux kernel version >= 4.7.x (for tag >= v0.4.0, and up to commits 2018-07-17), tested on UBUNTU desktop 16.04 64 bits.
  The S-GW network element requires a linux kernel version = 4.9.x (for tag >= v0.4.0, and after commits 2018-07-17), tested on UBUNTU desktop 16.04 64 bits (xenial).

Contributions request
#---------------------
  In a general way, anybody who is willing can contribute on any part of the 
  code in any network component. Contributions can be simple bugfixes, advices
  and remarks on the design, architecture, coding/implementation, are can can 
  size up to a project collaboration.

  - We are working to upgrade to Rel14 (done by Sprint for HSS), help is needed for other Network Functions.
  - Would be good to have Cisco VPP+GTPU integrated with SPGW.
  - Integrate and fill Sprint release of PCEF, PCRF.
  - Improve SPGW code quality (would go also for C++ for SPGW higher layers, ITTI, and utils).
